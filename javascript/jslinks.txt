In JavaScript, every variable or function declaration you bring to the top of its current scope is called hoisting. 
Question 1
1. What is the difference between undefined and not defined in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, if you try to use a variable that doesn't exist and has not been declared, then JavaScript will throw an error var name is not defined and script will stop executing. However, if you use typeof undeclared_variable, then it will return undefined.

Before getting further into this, let's first understand the difference between declaration and definition.

Let's say var x is a declaration because you have not defined what value it holds yet, but you have declared its existence and the need for memory allocation.
